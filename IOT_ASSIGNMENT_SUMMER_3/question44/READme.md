# Smart Greenhouse Monitoring and Control System

## Problem Statement

Greenhouses require continuous monitoring of environmental conditions to ensure healthy plant growth. Temperature, humidity, and light intensity must remain within optimal ranges to maximize crop yield. This project implements an IoT-based greenhouse monitoring system using an ESP32 that automatically controls heating, ventilation, and lighting while publishing sensor data to an MQTT broker for remote monitoring.

## Solution Approach

The system uses an ESP32 to monitor temperature and humidity through a DHT22 sensor and ambient light using an LDR. A moving average filter is applied to the LDR readings to reduce noise and provide stable light measurements.

Based on predefined thresholds with hysteresis, the ESP32 automatically controls a heater, ventilation fan, and artificial lighting. The current environmental conditions and actuator states are displayed on a 16×2 I2C LCD, which cycles through multiple information screens every three seconds.

The ESP32 connects to a Wi-Fi network and publishes sensor readings and actuator statuses to the HiveMQ public MQTT broker, allowing real-time monitoring through MQTT clients such as MQTT Explorer.

## MQTT Topics

| Topic                    | Description             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `greenhouse/temp`        | Temperature (°C)        |
| `greenhouse/humidity`    | Humidity (%)            |
| `greenhouse/light`       | Average LDR value       |
| `greenhouse/heater`      | Heater status           |
| `greenhouse/fan`         | Fan status              |
| `greenhouse/lightStatus` | Artificial light status |

## Working Principle

1. Connect the ESP32 to the Wi-Fi network.
2. Read temperature and humidity from the DHT22 sensor.
3. Read ambient light using the LDR and calculate its running average.
4. Apply hysteresis-based control logic:

   * Turn on the heater if the temperature is below the lower threshold.
   * Turn on the fan if the temperature or humidity exceeds the upper threshold.
   * Turn on greenhouse lighting when ambient light is low.
5. Display sensor values and actuator states on the LCD.
6. Publish all sensor readings and device states to the MQTT broker every three seconds.
7. Print diagnostic information to the Serial Monitor.
