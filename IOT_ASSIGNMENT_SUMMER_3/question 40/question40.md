# Q40. (Theory) Explain QoS (Quality of Service) Levels in MQTT

## Objective

Understand the three MQTT **Quality of Service (QoS)** levels, their reliability guarantees, and determine the most suitable QoS level for an IoT water level monitoring system.

# What is QoS in MQTT?

**Quality of Service (QoS)** in MQTT defines the level of guarantee for message delivery between the publisher and the subscriber. It helps developers balance **reliability, network bandwidth, latency, and power consumption** based on the application's requirements.

MQTT provides **three QoS levels**:

# QoS Levels

| QoS Level | Delivery Guarantee | Description                                                                                     | Advantages                                                     | Disadvantages                                              |
| --------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **QoS 0** | **At most once**   | The message is sent only once without confirmation. If it is lost, it is not retransmitted.     | Fastest communication, lowest bandwidth and power consumption. | Messages may be lost.                                      |
| **QoS 1** | **At least once**  | The sender waits for an acknowledgment (ACK). If no ACK is received, the message is sent again. | Reliable delivery with low overhead.                           | Duplicate messages may occur.                              |
| **QoS 2** | **Exactly once**   | Uses a four-step handshake to ensure the message is delivered exactly one time.                 | Highest reliability with no duplicate messages.                | Highest bandwidth usage, latency, and processing overhead. |

# Recommended QoS for an IoT Water Level Monitoring System

### Recommended: **QoS 1 (At Least Once)**

For an IoT water level monitoring system, **QoS 1** is the best choice because it provides reliable message delivery while maintaining good network efficiency.

### Reasons

* Water level readings are important for detecting floods or low-water conditions.
* Losing a critical reading could delay alerts and affect safety.
* QoS 1 ensures that messages are delivered even if the network connection is temporarily unstable.
* Although duplicate messages may occur, the monitoring application can easily ignore repeated readings using timestamps or message IDs.
* QoS 2 provides greater reliability but introduces additional communication overhead and latency, making it unnecessary for most sensor monitoring applications.
* QoS 0 is lightweight but risks losing important sensor data.

Therefore, **QoS 1 offers the best balance between reliability, bandwidth usage, and response time for water level monitoring systems.**

---

# Practical Example

A river monitoring station measures the water level every 10 seconds.

* **QoS 0:** A reading may be lost if the network drops.
* **QoS 1:** The reading is retransmitted until the cloud acknowledges it.
* **QoS 2:** The reading is guaranteed to arrive exactly once but requires more communication, increasing latency and power consumption.

# Conclusion

MQTT provides three QoS levels to support different IoT applications. **QoS 0** is suitable for non-critical telemetry where occasional message loss is acceptable. **QoS 1** provides reliable delivery with minimal overhead, making it ideal for most monitoring systems. **QoS 2** offers the highest reliability but at the cost of additional bandwidth and latency.

For an **IoT water level monitoring system**, **QoS 1 (At Least Once)** is the preferred choice because it ensures reliable data delivery while maintaining efficient network and power usage.
